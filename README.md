# ERP-For-Coronavirus
This is a complete ERP system for listing corona-virus cases made in C# and SQLite.
This is written in Greek language.
You're supposed to be an employee logging into the system and then you have the options to 1) Add a Case, 2)View all Cases, 3) Delete and Alter the Cases.
The program comes with some dummy data I've added in the Database.
The username and password are both respectively the letter 'n' and 'n'.
Once you've logged in you see 3 buttons: "Εισαγωγη-Insertion", "Προβολη-All cases", "Τροποποιηση-Modification".
The first button lets you fill some of the case's information and adding it in the database while the second button shows you all the cases recorded
The third button promts you to add the case's name and then it lets you modify the case's information and even to delete it. 
Head into the ERP-Coronavirus folder and then into bin/debug/ERP-Coronavirus.exe to run the program and make sure you've downloaded all the files because if not, an exception will rise.
